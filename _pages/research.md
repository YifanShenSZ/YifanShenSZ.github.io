## Diabatization
Most molecular simulations are based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where nucleus obey Newton's laws while electrons provide nothing but a potential energy surface. However, when the electronic dynamics is essential, e.g. in photochemical process or charge transport, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks. Under such circumstances, diabatization is the prerequisite for the coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics

We have developed a theory and code that can diabatize even the extreme cases, e.g. conical intersections

## Vibronic spectrum
An example of the coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics is the vibronic spectrum, where spectroscopy measures the transition between the coupled vibrational and electronic (vib-ronic) states

Since spectroscopy is governed by quantum mechanics, the simulation used to be limited to extremely small molecules (less than 10 atoms). We have developed a theory and code that can treat 18+ atoms. Our upper limit has not been reached yet, so we are still trying out larger and larger molecules
