I am a Ph. D. candidate in Prof. David Yarkony's group at Johns Hopkins University. I obtained my B. S. in chemistry and physics minor (2018) from Zhejiang University.

My research interest is developing nonadiabatic dynamics theory and software to understand and predict photochemistry in molecules and materials, aiming at a more sustainable future. Quantum mechanics, machine learning and programming make up my skill set in accomplishing my research projects.

As my 4th year at Johns Hopkins University approaches, I am looking for an intership for summer 2022. I would like to try a tech company to polish my machine learning and programming skills.
