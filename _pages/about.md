I am a Ph. D. candidate in Prof. David Yarkony's group at Johns Hopkins University. I obtained my B. S. in chemistry and physics minor (2018) from Zhejiang University.

My research is developing nonadiabatic dynamics theory and software to understand and predict photochemistry in molecules and materials, aiming at a more sustainable future. Quantum mechanics, machine learning and programming make up my skill set in accomplishing my research projects.

I am looking for **summer 2022 internship** as machine learning engineer, software development engineer, or data scientist, etc. I am looking forward to bringing solutions and ideas to life while working on cutting-edge technology.
